The gnuradio audio component provides an audio_source and audio_sink block.
The audio blocks stream floating point samples to and from audio hardware.

The gr-audio will be built automatically when gnuradio-core is enabled.
Support for underlying audio architectures depends on OS and installed libraries.
At the time of writing, gr-audio supports oss, alsa, jack, portaudio, audiounit, and winmm.

At runtime, gr-audio will automatically select from the available architectures.
The user can override the selection via configuration file by setting "audio_module"
to one of the following strings: oss, alsa, jack, portaudio, osx, or windows.
See gr-audio.conf for an example.
