GNU Radio wrapper is a tool to generate the vaild GNU Radio componenet
from pre-define parameter and template. In current GNU Radio standard, 
a vaild signal processing componenet need kernel, testing and interface
in C/C++ and Python. In SSP project, we use semantics to capture and 
representate the signal processing componenet in behavior level. And once 
we have the radio description, we could further re-host to GNU Radio platform
to further vailidation and application. 

The wrapper pre-define serveral template files. And we use Cheetah package to 
wrapper the semantics and template together through Python. 

usage:
1. Clone this repo
   git clone git@github.com:xingzhong/gnuradio.git
2. configure the file config.xml
   Entering the name, I/O Variable Name, Type and size, and Output Size. 
   Plus a re-hosting language choice: C or cuda
3. Replace the example/c/kernel file with your computation kernel
4. run the ssp.py, hopefully it will generate a whole package named by your configuration
5. put this module into the main GNU-Radio directory
6. Make the module and run the test file.
