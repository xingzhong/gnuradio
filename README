How to Build GNU Radio:

  (1) Ensure that you've satisfied the external dependencies listed
      below.  The word "system" is used to mean "operating system
      and/or distribution", and means a full operating system,
      including kernel, user-space utilties, and a packaging system
      for additional software.  On Linux, this means what
      "distribution" means.

      With the exception of SDCC, the following GNU/Linux
      distributions are known to come with all required dependencies
      pre-packaged: Ubuntu 8.10, SuSE 10.0 (the pay version, not the
      free download), Fedora Core 9.  Other distribution may work too.
      We know these three are easy.  The required packages may be
      contained on your installation CD/DVD, or may be loaded over the
      net.  The specifics vary depending on your GNU/Linux
      distribution.

      On systems using pkgsrc (e.g. NetBSD and Dragonfly), build
      meta-packages/gnuradio, which will build a previous release and
      force installation of the dependencies.  Then pkg_delete the
      gnuradio package, which will leave the dependencies.  (This
      should also work on OSX.)

      See the wiki at http://gnuradio.org for details.


  (2) Building from cmake:

      $ mkdir $(builddir)
      $ cd $(builddir)
      $ cmake [OPTIONS] $(srcdir)
      $ make
      $ make test
      $ sudo make instal



That's it!

		       KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES


  GNU Radio triggers bugs in g++ 3.3 for X86.  DO NOT USE GCC 3.3 on
  the X86 platform.  g++ 3.2, 3.4, and the 4.* series are known to work well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			  External dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisites: Before trying to build these from source, please try
your system's installation tool (apt-get, pkg_install, YaST, yum,
urpmi, etc.) first.  Most recent systems have these packages
available.

You'll need to do a bit of sleuthing to figure out what your OS and
packaging system calls these.  If your system uses the convention of
splitting files needed to run programs compiled with foo and files
needed to do the compilation into packages named foo and foo-devel,
install both packages.  (Most GNU/Linux systems are like this, but
pkgsrc is not and instead uses -devel to indicate a package of a
not-yet-released or unstable version.)

For those using pkgsrc, see gnuradio-pkg_chk.conf.  Those not using
pkgsrc may also find the list useful.

(0) GNU make

It used to be required to have a "reasonable make", meaning GNU make,
BSD make, or perhaps Solaris make.  It is now required to use GNU
make.  Version 3.81 should certainly work; the intent is not to
require the bleeding edge.

Note that the examples below are written with "make".  They probably
should say "gmake", as GNU make is installed as gmake when it is not
the native make.

(1) The "autotools"

       autoconf 2.57    or later
       automake 1.7.4   or later
       libtool  1.5     or later

If your system has automake-1.4, there's a good chance it also has
automake-1.7 or later.  Check your install disk and/or (on GNU/Linux)
try:

  $ man update-alternatives

for info on how some distributions support multiple versions.


(2)  pkgconfig 0.15.0 or later  http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/pkgconfig

From the web site:

pkgconfig is a system for managing library compile/link flags that
works with automake and autoconf. It replaces the ubiquitous *-config
scripts you may have seen with a single tool.


(3)  FFTW 3.0 or later	      http://www.fftw.org

IMPORTANT!!!  When building FFTW, you MUST use the --enable-single and
--enable-shared configure options.  This builds the single precision
floating point version which we use.  You should also use either the
--enable-3dnow or --enable-sse options if you're on an Athlon or Pentium
respectively.

GNU/Linux packages of single-precision fftw are typically called
fftw3f.

In systems using pkgsrc, install math/fftwf, which provides the
single-precision libraries.


(4) Python 2.5 or later	      http://www.python.org

Python 2.5 or later is now required.  If your system splits
python into a bunch of separate packages including python-devel or
libpython you'll most likely need those too.


(5) Numpy python library   http://numeric.scipy.org

Provides a high performance array type for Python.
http://numpy.scipy.org
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=175103


(6) The Boost C++ Libraries (1.35 or later)  http://www.boost.org

We use Smart Pointers, the thread library and a bunch of other boost stuff.
If your system doesn't have boost 1.35 or later, see README.building-boost
for additional info.  (Note: Mac OSX systems require 1.37 or later.)


(7) cppunit 1.9.14 or later.	http://cppunit.sourceforge.net

Unit testing framework for C++.


(8) Simple Wrapper Interface Generator.  http://www.swig.org

As of repository version 4045, gnuradio requires version 1.3.31 or newer.


(9) SDCC: Small Device C Compiler.  http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/

--> Not required as of v3.5


(10) Guile 1.6 or 1.8 

Scheme interpreter.  http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html


(11) GNU Scientific Library (gsl) 1.10 or later

The GNU Radio core library uses some routines from here.


Optional, but nice to have:

(12) wxPython.  Python binding for the wxWidgets GUI framework.  Use
version 2.8 or later.  Again, almost all systems have this
available.

As a last resort, build it from source (not recommended!)
http://www.wxpython.org

(13) xmlto version ? or later.   http://cyberelk.net/tim/xmlto/index.html

Wrapper for XML conversion tools to ease e.g. making html from docbook.

(14) Python Cheetah extensions 2.0.0 or later
(15) Python lxml wrappers 2.0.0 or later
(16) Python gtk wrappers 2.10.0 or later

The GNU Radio Companion application requires these additional Python libraries
to be installed.

----------------------------------------------------------------

If you've got doxygen installed, the build process creates 
documentation for the class hierarchy etc.  Point your browser at
gnuradio/gnuradio-core/doc/html/index.html


To run the examples you may need to set PYTHONPATH.  Note that the
prefix and python version number in the path needs to match your
installed version of python.

  $ export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages

You may want to add this to your shell init file (~/.bash_profile if
you use bash).



Another handy trick if for example your fftw includes and libs are
installed in, say ~/local/include and ~/local/lib, instead of
/usr/local is this:

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/local/lib
    $ make CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/local/include"


Sometimes the prerequisites are installed in a location which is not
included in the default compiler and linker search paths.  This
happens with pkgsrc and NetBSD.  To build, tell configure to use these
locations:

	LDFLAGS="-L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include" ./configure --prefix=/usr/gnuradio

			  Legal Matters

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some files have been changed many times throughout the
years. Copyright notices at the tops of these files list which years
changes have been made. For some files, changes have occurred in many
consecutive years. These files may often have the format of a year
range (e.g., "2006 - 2011"), which indicates that these files have had
copyrightable changes made during each year in the range, inclusive.
